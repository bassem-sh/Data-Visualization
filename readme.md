## Dataset: Exploration Of PISA 2012 

 PISA is a survey of students' skills and knowledge as they approach the end of compulsory education. It is not a conventional school test. 

>Rather than examining how well students have learned the school curriculum, it looks at how well prepared they are for life beyond school.
Around 510,000 students in 65 economies took part in the PISA 2012 assessment of reading, mathematics, and science representing about 28 million 15-year-olds globally. The results were the combination of 5 exams in each subject, I got the average of every subject and I had to add a new column contain these averages, 'Avg Math score', 'Avg Read score', And 'Avg Science score'Â¶
I also chose from the 268 columns of the dataset only 30 columns that contain the most important variables in my investigation, and after removing the 5 exams and adding the averages It becomes 18 columns only.
I also saw some outliers in Wealth and Grade I had to remove them


## Summary of Findings
>### 1- Boys are better in math, and girls are better in reading, Both are nearly the same in science.
>### 2- Students from Asian countries are getting higher scores.
>### 3- Living with a parent is more effective to study better.
>### 4- Students who have more than 200 books have very big chance to get better scores.

## Key Insights for Presentation

>In this visualization The high data to ink ratio plots are preferred, The story shows how the main factors affect the average scores of students in Three subjects; Math, Reading, And science.
I focused in the main factor can do a difference in the students' scores as the absense of school, being with their parents, how many books in their homes, and which coutry they take the exam and which they came from. 
 I was predecting that wealth of the family can affect the students' grade, But I was surprised that there's no any relation.
